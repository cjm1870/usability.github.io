      <h2> Usability explanations </h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Text: I added contrast with the Head and the background and the body text, making it easily visable and passing the WAVE test.
        </li>
        <li> 
          Photo: Photo is clear with a caption describing it and it's relevance.
        </li>
        <li> Links: I added link to two of my projects previously in the class making them easily acessable with a one click link provided for both.
        </li>
        <li> 
          Page Structure: I made the page flow with the use of unorganized and organized lists making it easy to read and find what you are looking for on the page quite easily.
